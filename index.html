          <p class="author-bio">Grace Shao is a high schooler from Maryland. She scored a perfect 1600 on the SAT the summer after eighth grade. Since then, she has taught for nonprofits, hosted SAT seminars, and run her school's weekly SAT prep club. Grace has always loved to draw, and she took inspiration from colorful children's books and her past “Super Grace” comics to create <em>SAT Reading Reframed</em>.</p>

      <h2>The Goal</h2>
      <div class="goal-content">
        <p><strong>Let's work to make quality, engaging SAT prep available to every student.</strong></p>
        <p>The SAT is hard because students don't know where to start. A high score isn't about being "smart enough," it's about effective test prep: learning the right material the right way. With <em>SAT Reading Reframed</em>, I offer not only my best SAT strategies but also lifelong advice on self-reflection, improving from mistakes, and handling pressure. This isn't a textbook; it's your study buddy.</p>
        <p>The SAT is hard, but studying doesn't have to be. All students need is a comprehensive, enjoyable guide and some teenager-to-teenager advice. From SAT workshops at schools and libraries to donating nearly two hundred copies of <em>SAT Reading Reframed</em>, I want every student to conquer the SAT.</p>
